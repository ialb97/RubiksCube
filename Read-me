Read Me:
G = Green
Y = Yellow
B = Blue
O = Orange
W = White
R = Red
r = right
l = left

Rotations directionality is based on the orientation of the cube if you were looking at that color.
For example, if you are looking at the blue face, Br will rotate the blue face to the right/clockwise
and Bl will rotate the blue face to the left/counterclockwise.

The middle rotations work the same way where if you look at that color the middle pane from that
perspective will rotate. For example if looking at the Yellow face and performing Y mid-pane right
will result in the middle pane parallel to the yellow pane to rotate to the right.

This code has only been tested in chrome or firefox so please use one of those browsers when testing.

Happy Cubing!
